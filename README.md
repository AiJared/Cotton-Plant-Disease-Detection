## Defining some parameters for the loader

Batch size is set to 32

image height set to 180 and 

image width set to 180

## Splitting the Dataset into Training and Validation

The data is split into training and validation

Training set is given 80% of the data and 

Validation set is given 20% of the data

## Classes

The dataset is classified into two classes based on the images.

The first class is of diseased crops' images and 

The second class is of healthy crops' images as shown below
